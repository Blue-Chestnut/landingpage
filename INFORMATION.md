## Features

### Schema Registry

The core to EverBlue is the schema registry. The schema registry is a database
that stores all of the schemas for your systems in one place. It does not only
store the schema of your tables, you can also add information on how and on what
to partition and bucket the data on. You can also add information on how the
schemas relate to each other.

### Schema Editor

The schema editor is a frontend application that allows you to easily edit the
schemas in a visual interface. Or if you just want to explore the schemas.

### PySpark SDK

PySpark is the most popular way to do data engineering. EverBlue provides a SDK
for easy interactions with the central schema registry. You can use the SDK to
load and write data in a save manner without having to worry about the details.
